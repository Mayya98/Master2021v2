Rachmaninoff Piano Concerto N2

Liszt Hungarian Rhapsody N12
desc:
Liszt did not usually modify the rhythm of a passage in such a way that
it could be misconstrued as some other rhythm; rather that he exaggerated the rhythmic gestures
without concern for the mathematical accuracy of rhythmic subdivisions. If one note is lengthened
slightly, the next one might be rushed over—while the underlying pulse may stay more-or-less in
place. This description is one which reflects the practice found in the playing of several of Liszt's
pupils—short ornaments, particularly, tend to be played quicker than written, often with a slight
pause on the first note.

Other text:
Chemical energy is the energy of chemical substances that is released when they undergo a chemical reaction and transform into other substances. Some examples of storage media of chemical energy include batteries,food, gasoline, and oxygen gas. Breaking and re-making of chemical bonds involves energy, which may be either absorbed by or evolved from a chemical system.
Energy that can be released or absorbed because of a reaction between chemical substances is equal to the difference between the energy content of the products and the reactants, if the initial and final temperature is the same.
